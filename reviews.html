                Tagaytay as our family bonding trip, we had the chance to see Taal's beauty while eating
                delicious Bulalo together. Overall, this trip was really worth it and we enjoyed visiting.</span></div>

                one of my best decisions. The amazing delicacies this place has to offer is really mesmerizing, 
                we tried out many foods such as flavorful Bulalo, Kare-Kare and a lot more. Though we tasted many 
                wonderful foods, one food will always be close to my heart, it was their Buko Pie.</span></div>

                currently lives in Taguig. My Grandma recommended that we visit Tagaytay City as a way 
                to spend time with each other. It was really fun spending time with each other while seeing
                beautiful sights that Tagaytay had to offer.</span></div>

                World Lemery Castle to look at and photograph the beautiful castles. We also went to the well-known
                Taal Lake. I was able to take numerous photographs for Memories of this experience. Overall, this
                trip was relaxing and enjoyable.</span></div>

                so I especially love going there to eat Bulalo after a long day of work. Though Mahogany Beef Market
                is usually crowded, it is worth it because It never fails to lighten up my mood.</span></div>

                One of my favorite exercises is walking, It's a lot of fun strolling around Tagaytay due to the cold
                weather and it's breathtaking views.</span></div>

                Biking all the way to Tagaytay is a lot of fun, though there are some upward roads but once you get to the top
                it's gonna be a relief because Tagaytay has cold weather due to it's high altitude.</span></div>
