            <h3>Historical Facts about Tagaytay</h3>
            <p>
                Because of its thickly wooded environs, Tagaytay became a haven for Katipunero revolutionaries during the 1896 Philippine revolution. The Katipuneros from the towns of Masilao (now Amadeo), Malabon Grande (now Gen. Trias), Silang, Dasmarinas, Mendez,
                and Indang would seek cover in the rolling topography of Tagaytay, which soon became a passage for revolutionaries heading to and from Cavite to other nearby provinces.

                Tagaytay has been a chartered city since June 21, 1938. This was declared by Commonwealth Act 338 under then-President Manuel L. Quezon.
