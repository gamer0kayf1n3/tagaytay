            <p>Tagaytay is actually doing quite well economically. As a second class city, Tagaytay is earning an average of more than Php 20 million but less than Php 30 million.. Tagaytay is the region's second-largest contributor to GDP. There are more
                employees and employers as a result of this. At the same time, industries in Tagaytay have a greater potential for creating better jobs. </p>
            <p>Despite rapid urbanization of Tagaytay, agriculture remains an important part of the city's economy and development. As of 2009, it is recorded that there is about 1,292 hectares (3,190 acres) of agricultural land which is about 20 percent
                of the city's total land area. </p>
            <p>
                The Taal volcano can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. While many people want to visit Tagaytay to see the wondrous sights of the Taal volcano, the fact that it is an active volcano can drag the economy down. The volcano erupted once in 2020, with
                ash covering the majority of the city and its surrounding areas. There were a few casualties, which had an impact on Tagaytay's economy. It took officials about two weeks to get back up and restart the region's economy. We must also remember
                what the pandemic has done to Tagaytay. Businesses were closed and jobs were lost in an instant, just like in any other region of the Philippines.
