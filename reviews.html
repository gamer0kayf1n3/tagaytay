                Tagaytay as our family bonding trip, we had the chance to see Taal's beauty while eating
                delicious Bulalo together. Overall, this trip was really worth it and we enjoyed visiting.</span></div>

            <div class="user-review"><span>Decided to have a solo trip 1 month ago, visiting Tagaytay is 
                one of my best decisions. The amazing delicacies this place has to offer is really mesmerizing, 
                we tried out many foods such as flavorful Bulalo, Kare-Kare and a lot more. Though we tasted many 
                wonderful foods, one food will always be close to my heart, it was their Buko Pie.</span></div>

            <div class="user-review"><span>Came all the way from Canada just to visit my family that 
                currently lives in Taguig. My Grandma recommended that we visit Tagaytay City as a way 
                to spend time with each other. It was really fun spending time with each other while seeing
                beautiful sights that Tagaytay had to offer.</span></div>

                seeing beautiful sceneries everywhere. Honestly, what more can you ask for.</span></div>
